This is a simple, accessible dashboard for examining NI voting trends since 2001. The application will allow users to see results across a range of general elections, up to December 2019, either in one of the 18 constituencies or for the full six counties. The dashboard will also display Brexit referendum results. The information will be selected through a choropleth constituency map of the north of Ireland.

To demo, run the html file over a live server:

Go to the directory where project has been cloned
`cd /path/to/milestone-2`
Start a http server with the method of your choice
`http-server`
