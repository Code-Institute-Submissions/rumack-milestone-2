This is a simple, accessible dashboard for examining NI voting trends between 2001 and 2019. The application allows users to see and compare results across a range of general elections, from 2001 up to December 2019, either in one of the 18 constituencies or for the full six counties. The dashboard also displays Brexit referendum results by constituency and overall. 

The information is first accessed through a stacked bar chart that displays seat tallies by party and by year. The stacked chart is linked to a map which will highlight the relevant constituencies when the stacked chart is hovered or touched. Dynamic html is generated to give extra details about seat numbers, constituencies, parties etc.

The user is then encouraged to click on the map to generate a constituency profile, and to update the three lower charts (bar chart: vote share percentage, line chart : vote share trends, pie chart: brexit result). Clicking on each of the constituencies on the map generates a profile and updates the charts.

To demo, run the html file over a live server:

Go to the directory where project has been cloned
`cd /path/to/milestone-2`
Start a http server with the method of your choice
`http-server`
